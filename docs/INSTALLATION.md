   - Select your ESP32 device from the list
   - Wait for connection confirmation

3. **Choose Learning Mode**
   - Navigate to Chat screen
   - Select your preferred educational mode
   - Set appropriate difficulty level

### Advanced Configuration

#### LLM Model Setup
1. **Download Models** (optional)
   - Models can be downloaded from Hugging Face
   - Supported formats: GGUF quantized models
   - Place in `Android/data/com.smartbot/files/models/`

2. **Model Configuration**
   - TinyLLaMA: ~669MB, good for basic conversations
   - Phi-2: ~1.5GB, better reasoning capabilities
   - Mistral 7B: ~4GB, advanced conversations (requires 6GB+ RAM)

#### Network Configuration
- **WiFi Setup**: ESP32 creates "SmartBot_Robot" network (password: smartbot123)
- **Bluetooth**: Automatic pairing with "SmartBot_ESP32" device

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### App Won't Install
- **Solution**: Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Android settings
- **Alternative**: Use `adb install` command if building from source

#### Bluetooth Connection Fails
- **Check**: Bluetooth is enabled on both devices
- **Verify**: Location permission is granted (required for Bluetooth scanning)
- **Try**: Restart Bluetooth on Android device
- **Reset**: Clear Bluetooth cache in Android settings

#### Robot Doesn't Respond
- **Power**: Ensure ESP32 and motors have adequate power supply
- **Connections**: Verify all wiring connections are secure
- **Firmware**: Confirm firmware is properly flashed
- **Range**: Stay within 10 meters for Bluetooth, 30 meters for WiFi

#### Voice Recognition Not Working
- **Permissions**: Ensure microphone permission is granted
- **Network**: Some features require internet for speech recognition
- **Noise**: Try in a quieter environment
- **Language**: Check that device language is supported

#### Camera Features Not Working
- **Permissions**: Ensure camera permission is granted
- **Lighting**: Ensure adequate lighting for object detection
- **Focus**: Tap to focus camera on objects
- **Performance**: Close other camera apps

### Performance Optimization

#### For Low-End Devices
- Disable computer vision features if not needed
- Use smaller LLM models (TinyLLaMA)
- Reduce sensor sampling rate
- Close background apps

#### For Better Battery Life
- Lower screen brightness
- Disable unnecessary sensors
- Use WiFi instead of Bluetooth when possible
- Enable battery optimization for the app
